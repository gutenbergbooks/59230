</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN old Japan the mirror occupies a
peculiarly important place. Travellers
in that land of strange
arts and quaint customs tell us of
mirror-worship as one of its forms
of primitive religion. In old Japan the mirror
is not, as in our Western civilization, a mere
article of furniture, an accessory of the toilet,
or a means for covering up the otherwise indecorate
breadth of wall above a mantel-piece.
One finds the mirror in Japan surrounded
with pomp and circumstance on every hand.
It is prominent amongst the symbolic objects
that constitute the imperial regalia of the
Shogun. One sees it depicted in Japanese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
pictures of the infernal regions. In the temples
of the old Shinto religion, precious old mirrors
are enshrined in costly arks, only to be exhibited
on the occasion of some great ceremony. Innumerable
mirrors, some of them of old date,
but mostly of modern manufacture, are to be
found hung upon the walls of the Shinto
temples. There they have been deposited as
votive offerings by women who had perhaps
nought else so precious to offer. As the
Japanese warrior offers as a votive gift to the
temple his cherished sword, so the Japanese
lady bestows her treasured mirror. There they
hang in thousands, swords and mirrors, side by
side, thank-offerings to the gods. In the scant
furniture of the Japanese <i>ménage</i>, the mirror,
reposing in its place upon the lady&#8217;s toilet-table,
forms the one significant object; the central
feature to suit which all the rest is subordinated.
The mirror enters into the myths of the
Japanese race: it is the emblem of light, or
the sun, and of the divine right of the dynasty.
In the trousseau of the bride the mirror is the
most precious object&mdash;her one cherished possession.
The first-made mirror&mdash;or the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
held to be such in the estimation of the Japanese,
and venerated accordingly&mdash;is enshrined in the
great sacred twin-palace at Isé, the holy spot
to which pious pilgrims turn their steps with
devoted zeal. Its origin is related in the famous
myth of the sun-goddess, Amaterasu oho-mi-kami,
who, on one occasion, withdrew offended
to a rocky cavern, leaving the world in darkness.
From this retreat she was enticed by
the other gods, after many curious artifices had
been tried, by their successful making of a
mirror, in which seeing her face reflected, she
was impelled by jealousy and curiosity to
venture forth. This mirror was fashioned by
the Vulcan of the Shinto Olympus to imitate the
sun, being in shape a disk with eight rays. In
modern Japanese heraldry the sun, as blazoned
upon the national flag, is a red orb with sixteen
red rays, not pointed as in European heraldry,
but widening out to the margin of the flag.
Some hold that the Japanese imperial crest, the
<i>kiku</i>, which resembles a flower with sixteen
petals joined and rounded at the outer extremities,
and issuing from a small central disk, is
also a blazon of the sun; others hold it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
represent the chrysanthemum. In Japanese
pictures of the sun-goddess myth, the mirror
is always represented as of the eight-point form.
Tradition states that the flaw still to be seen
in its surface was caused by a blow it received
when the gods thrust it into the half-opened
doorway of the rocky cavern as the sun-goddess
peeped out. The standard version of the
entire myth is to be found in a memoir on the
Shinto Temples of Isé by Mr. Ernest Satow,
in the second volume of the &#8220;Transactions of
the Asiatic Society of Japan&#8221; (1873-74). In
the British Museum, in Dr. Anderson&#8217;s collection
of Japanese drawings, No. 1905, there
is a silk roll painted in colours, depicting the
scene outside the cavern. It is without signature
or seal, and the artist is unknown. A
further myth narrates the subsequent history
of the mirror. It was handed by the sun-goddess
to her grandson Nini-gi no mikoto
when he descended from heaven to subdue the
earth, along with the sacred sword and the
sacred seal-stone (the three sacred treasures
of the Japanese regalia), with these words:
&#8220;Look upon this mirror as my spirit: keep it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
in the same house and on the same floor with
yourself, and worship it as if you were worshipping
my actual presence.&#8221; Nini-gi no
mikoto founded the empire of Japan, and is
worshipped as the first Shogun, all subsequent
sovereigns claiming divine right by descent from
him. All mirrors in Shinto temples, whether
exposed to view or concealed in shrines or
arks, are imitations of this one, though some
are regarded as being representative of other
secondary deities. At Isé, where the first
mirror is preserved, each mirror is enclosed in
a box standing on a stand, and covered with a
cloth of silk. The mirror is itself wrapped in
a brocade bag, which is never opened or renewed,
but which, when nearly worn out, is
enclosed in a new bag. Over the numerous
wrappings is a cage of wood with gold ornaments,
draped with a curtain of coarse silk.
At festivals, when they open the shrines, all
that can be seen is the boxes with the coverings
over them.</p>

<p>The mirror of old Japan is however a very
different article from that known in modern
Europe as a mirror. European mirrors are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
made, as everyone knows, of glass silvered at
the back. Japanese mirrors are invariably
made of metal, the bronze employed being a
compound of copper and tin, with traces of
antimony or lead.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The mirrors preserved
in the temples are not all of the eight-pointed
form. Some are simply circular, with a thick
rim behind, and a central button perforated
to receive a suspending cord; the front being
quite plane. Others are oval, with feet, or
with perforated handles at the upper part for
suspension. In the houses square mirrors are
very rarely met with, and these are mostly
small. Those for the lady&#8217;s toilet table are
usually circular, from four to five inches across,
without handles, possessing a thick rim and a
raised pattern on the back. Commonest of
all are the hand-mirrors, which are usually
circular, from three to eleven inches in diameter,
with a metal handle covered with bamboo
or with brocade. They are usually slightly
convex on the front surface, which is brightly
polished; while the back, which is for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
most part unpolished, exhibits a fine raised
pattern. Often the raised ornament consists
of two distinct kinds. There is made in high
relief, and polished bright so as to stand out
from the background, a simple bold symbolic
device, sometimes a Chinese character signifying
&#8220;good-luck,&#8221; or &#8220;long-life,&#8221; sometimes a
family crest, such as the imperial <i>kiri</i> (or
Paullonia leaves and flowers), or a circlet, or
three feathers crossed, or the jagged peak of
Fuji-yama, or the outline of a bird. Ornament
of the second kind is in low relief, and, though
often symbolic, consists of naturalistic representations
of trees, flowers, storks, bamboos,
and the like. A group comprising pine-trees,
storks, and the hairy-tailed tortoise, all symbols
of longevity or immortality, is a favourite one.
Sometimes the ornament consists exclusively
of one or other of these kinds; but more frequently
both are present; the unpolished low-relief
work forming an artistic background for
the crest or the Chinese letters, which stand
out polished. In passing it may be remarked
that the Japanese make use of Chinese characters
in addition to their own form of writing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
just as we still use old English black-letters for
ornamental or distinctive purposes.</p>


<p>But the most interesting thing about Japanese
mirrors&mdash;the one thing that has made them
famous and brought them to the notice of
lovers of the curious and the occult&mdash;is their
reputed <i>magical</i> property. Oriental stories of
magic mirrors have been current from the
middle ages, most of them wholly childish and
absurd. But along with these there have
existed accounts, of a more reliable character,
of mirrors which are capable of reflecting, in
a beam of light that falls on their face, the
pattern which they carry on their back. This
singular property is no myth, though the true
explanation of the phenomenon was long unknown.
When first seen, the phenomenon is
so startling that it seems almost incredible.
You take the mirror into your hand and
examine it. Its face is slightly convex, perfectly
polished, unless scratched by use or tarnished;
and on looking into it you see only
your own image, or the objects about you&mdash;not
a hint or trace of the raised pattern at the
back. Now hold up the mirror in direct sunlight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
or in the path of a powerful beam of
light from some artificial source, such as an
electric lamp. It will reflect back the beam,
and cast an illuminated patch on the wall or
floor, just as any other mirror will do. But
on examining this luminous patch you will at
once observe&mdash;if your mirror is a good one&mdash;that
the salient features, and sometimes even
the fine details, of the pattern on the back
are reproduced in the light reflected from the
front. Some dozens of Japanese mirrors, most
of them quite modern, have passed through the
hands of the author for optical examination.
Some of these failed to show any magical properties
whatever. Others showed the property
very well. Others again, which showed nothing
at first, were found capable of being converted
into magic mirrors by a course of treatment
subsequently discovered.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_pl_2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate II.</span></p>

<p>Down to about 1845 these mirrors were
excessively rare in Europe, though it is quite
possible that they may have occasionally formed
part of the stock-in-trade of mediæval conjurors
and magicians. Amidst the mass of
occult rubbish one may here and there discern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
statements probably relating to the genuine
phenomena exhibited by mirrors of the class in
question, having little or nothing in common
with the visions to be seen in crystal spheres,
or beryls, or in pools of ink. Thus Gaspard
Schott, both in his &#8220;Physica Curiosa&#8221; and in
his book on Magic, refers to the Mirror of
Pythagoras, in or on which he is said to have
written in blood the things which he wished to
signify, and which, when turned to the moon,
displayed upon the disk of the moon, visibly to
one standing behind, the things so inscribed.
The &#8220;disk of the moon&#8221; here referred to may
have been simply the luminous patch cast by
the reflected moonbeam.</p>

<p>Again, it is stated that the Italian historian,
Muratori, makes two references to magic
mirrors, one in the possession of Bishop Bartolomeo
of Verona, who was murdered by
Mastino della Scala in 1338; the other found
in the house of Cola di Rienzo (or Rienzi),
which had upon its back the word &#8220;Fiorone.&#8221;
Not having been able to verify the statement
from literature available in the British Museum,
I am in doubt about the last case. It is much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
more likely that the mirror bore on its back a
large flower, than that it bore the word meaning
a large flower.</p>

<p>Except for obscure references such as these,
there is no record of real magic mirrors prior
to 1832. Yet a few did undoubtedly exist.
There were some in the collection of the royal
family of Savoy at Turin, which were later examined
by Professor Govi. There was one
reputed to be magical in Berlin. The great
Von Humboldt thought it worth his while, in
1830, to bring this mirror to Paris to show it
to his <i>confrères</i> of the <i>Académie des Sciences</i>;
but having brought it, found himself unable to
show anything. In 1842 several mirrors were
brought from Nankin by Admiral Mouchez
(commander of &#8220;La Favorite&#8221;), M. Arosa,
and M. Piou. One was in the possession of
the Marquis La Grange in 1847.</p>

<p>With the opening of Japan to the commercial
world, in 1867, came the export of mirrors
amongst other articles of metal-work; amongst
them some that were of magic quality. One
was displayed in 1876 in the Loan Collection
of Scientific Apparatus in the western galleries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of the South Kensington Museum. The official
Catalogue (p. 927) thus describes it: &#8220;983 c.
Magic Mirror. [Exhibited by] Robert von
Tarnow. This mirror is a curiosity, and
consists of a brass concave disc with finely
polished surface. At the reverse rough side
there are several Arabic (<i>sic</i>) characters in
relief. By exposing the polished surface to
the rays of the sun in such a way that they
reflect them on the wall, the Arabic figures of
the reverse side of the disc become plainly visible
in the reflected light on the wall.&#8221; It was this
mirror which, in the following year, the
present writer had in mind when, writing in
&#8220;Nature,&#8221; he proposed that an investigation
should be made into the strange optical
property so exhibited. Happily at that time
his friend Professor W. E. Ayrton was
resident in Japan as Professor in the Imperial
College of Engineering at Tokio, and he and
his colleague, Professor Perry, at once engaged
in an exhaustive research on the subject, in the
course of which they not only examined some
hundreds of mirrors, but also acquainted themselves
on the actual spot with the methods of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
manufacture, which until then were entirely
unknown, or misunderstood. A year or two
later, after the publication of the researches of
Ayrton and Perry, other researches of an
entirely confirmatory character were published
in France by M. Bertin. In fact, the scientific
investigations may be sharply divided into four
periods.</p>

<p>(<i>i.</i>) 1832. Elementary guesses by Brewster
and Prinsep, the former of whom ascribed the
phenomenon to some supposed molecular
changes in the metal at the surface, due to a
pattern having been stamped on the front to
imitate that on the back, and then ground off.
The latter ascribed it more correctly to differences
of curvature of surface, but also fell
into the error of supposing the ornament to
have been stamped.</p>

<p>(<i>ii.</i>) 1844-1853. French investigations by
Arago, Julien, Person, and Maillard. Of
these investigators Person gave the suggestion
of the true cause, namely, minute differences
of curvature in the polished surface, a circumstance
which he proved by covering the mirror
with a piece of paper having a circular hole,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
about one centimetre in diameter, and which,
when moved about over the mirror (in sunlight),
caused as a reflected image a spot of light, the
size of which varied from point to point of the
mirror. He also soldered a narrow slip of
sheet metal behind a polished daguerreotype
plate, and found that when the latter was
slightly bent the image from the front showed
a luminous line at the corresponding place.
Maillard later adopted Person&#8217;s theory, and
confirmed it by employing an optician to
burnish on the lathe a piece of metal which
had raised markings on its back. He also
noted that a scratch on the mirror back gives
a bright line in the image.</p>

<p>(<i>iii.</i>) 1864-66. Investigations of Govi, in
Italy, and his controversy with Brewster
thereon. Govi frankly adopted the views of
Person, and confirmed them by an experiment
based on the mode adopted by the constructors
of reflecting telescopes for testing the accuracy
of the figure given by the grinding machinery
to specula. He caused a magic mirror to
reflect upon a screen the image of a fine grating
of lines, ruled upon glass with a diamond,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and placed close to a brilliant point of light.
By the distortions which the mirror produced
in these lines he found the whole reflecting
surface to be minutely undulated over with
slight variations of curvature in complete
correspondence with the raised arabesques on
the back. These undulations, he observed,
escape notice when one is looking into the
face of the mirror because they are so gentle,
and are such that, to perceive them, we require
organs that are more delicate than our own.
On the publication of this account, and of a
translation of it in the &#8220;Scientific Review&#8221;
for 1865, Sir David Brewster wrote to say
how, in 1832, he had explained the phenomenon
as being due to differences of density or
other quality of molecular structure, or to fine
scratches produced by trickery, and doubting
Govi&#8217;s explanation. He declared that similar
phenomena had been produced by stamping
patterns into the face of brass and grinding
them down to be invisible on inspection. He
considered the only way in which they could
be proved to be due to delicate differences of
curvature was either to show that they disappeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
on re-surfacing the mirror with a
soft speculum-tool, or by taking an exact cast
from the mirror, and seeing whether this also
had magic properties. Govi thus challenged,
at once disproved Brewster&#8217;s position, and
established his own by showing that the
character of the image, white lines on dull
ground, is changed to that of dull lines on
a brighter ground, by simply interposing in
front of the mirror a convex lens. This
effect can only be produced by difference of
curvature of surface. Further, Govi performed
the following striking experiment.
Taking a Japanese mirror which ordinarily
showed no magic effects, he heated it behind
with a spirit lamp, when at once it acquired
magic properties. He further improvised with
a piece of daguerreotype plate, and a metal ring
which he soldered to the back at as low a
temperature as possible, a mirror which showed
the same effects when, by heating, there arose
an unequal expansion between the thin and
the thick parts.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate III.</span></p>

<p>(<i>iv.</i>) 1878-80. Researches of Ayrton and
Perry, and those of Bertin, of Laurent, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Muraoka. First, Ayrton and Perry set about
procuring mirrors from the shops in Japan,
and found that the vendors were in many
cases wholly ignorant of the existence of the
magic property. Further, the mirror makers
could not say how the mirrors became magic,
nor which of their mirrors were such; or they
gave explanations subsequently found false, declaring
the effect to be produced by application
of an acid paste to etch the face prior to polishing.
The investigators then, having procured
some good mirrors, proceeded to test the various
possible suggestions as to the origin, such as
the supposed difference of density, or of
molecular constitution, or the supposed inlaying
of the face with inferior metal, or to
supposed concealed scratches on the surface, or,
finally, to differences of curvature. By simple
experiments in which bright light was caused
successively to fall upon the mirror in diverging,
parallel, or converging beams, it was
demonstrated beyond question that the last-named
cause was the true one. The whole
phenomenon is explained if once it could be
established that the surface over the thick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
parts is flatter (less convex, or even actually
slightly concave) than the surface over the
thin parts. Using a large convex lens to converge
sunlight that had been reflected from a
mirror, they showed that by merely altering
the distance of the screen on which the image
was received they could make the image
either positive or negative at will; a result
impossible on any other hypothesis than that
of differences of curvature of surface. This
being established, they then investigated the
process of mirror manufacture, to ascertain
how these delicate inequalities of surface arise;
and they found it to be due to an accident, or
incident, of manufacture. All the finished
Japanese mirrors may be observed to be slightly
convex in the face. They are cast in moulds,
the surface of each half of which is quite flat
save for the ornament incised on the mould for
the back. The following is Ayrton and Perry&#8217;s
description of the process of casting.</p>

<p>&#8220;The material used for making the mould
is a mixture of a special kind of clay (found
near Tokio and Osaka), with water and straw-ash.
Two suitable slabs having been formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
from this plastic compound with the aid of
wooden frames, a thick layer of half-liquid
mixture of powdered old crucibles, or of a fine
powder called <i>to-no-ko</i>, made from a soft kind
of whetstone, is spread on them. The design
for the back of the mirror is then cut directly
on one half of the mould, or a sketch drawn
on paper is first stuck on and used as a guide
in cutting the design in the clay. Sometimes,
but rarely, the design is stamped in the clay
with a pattern wood-block cut in relief like
the proposed back of the mirror. After the
design is complete, a rim of the same material
as that used in the construction of the mould,
and having a thickness equal to that desired
for the mirror, is attached to one half of the
mould. The two halves are then dried in the
smoke of a pine-tree fire, pressed and tied
together, and laid in the casting-box at an angle
of 80° to the horizon, the half of the mould on
which the design has been cut being uppermost.
Finally the molten speculum metal is
run into a number of moulds at the same time,
which, when cold, are broken up, and the
castings removed. Mirrors cast in a mould, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
which the design has been cut by hand, are
called <i>ichi mai buki</i>, &#8216;mould used once,&#8217; and
are regarded as artists&#8217; proofs, as the design on
the back is well defined. To form subsequent
moulds the two halves are pressed, when the
clay is wet, on an <i>ichi mai buki</i> mirror, and
the pattern is in this way transferred, but the
designs on the backs of the mirrors cast in such
moulds are not as clear as on an <i>ichi mai buki</i>
mirror, which therefore sells for a much higher
price.&#8221; Flaws in the face of the casting are
filled by inserting little balls of copper&mdash;giving
rise, perhaps, to the idea that inlaying was used
to produce the illusions. The handle is not
cast along with the disk of the mirror, but is
attached afterwards. Mirror castings when
they are removed from the mould are roughly
flat on the face, and need to be subjected to
several processes to finish their reflecting surfaces:
during these processes they acquire their
characteristic convexity and their high polish.
The mirror is laid down on its back on a wooden
board, and then scraped or scratched with a
rounded iron rod about a foot long, called a
<i>megebo</i> (&#8220;distorting rod&#8221;). The process of scoring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
over with the blunt tool is called <i>mege</i>. After
being scored all over with scratches in every
direction, it is found to be convex. Next the
face is scraped with a hand-scraping tool, then
rubbed down with a whetstone, then polished
over with a piece of magnolia-charcoal; and
lastly, when quite smooth, the amalgam of tin
and mercury is rubbed in with a stiff straw
brush, and polished off with soft paper.
Thicker mirrors are sometimes pared down
with a knife to the convex shape: they seldom
or never show magic properties. The knife
is also used to pare down any portion which in
the operation <i>mege</i> may have become too convex.
The convexity is tested from time to time by
applying a concave wooden form. Professor
Ayrton was of opinion that the magic properties
were conferred during the operation of
scraping with the <i>megebo</i>, the thicker parts of
the mirror yielding less, and therefore being
polished down more than the thinner parts.
He also noted that if the face was scored by
the <i>megebo</i> with parallel lines in one direction
only, the convexity acquired was cylindrical.
His conclusion was: &#8220;It appears then that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the magic of the Eastern mirror results from
no subtle trick on the part of the maker, from
no inlaying of other metal, or hardening of
portions by stamping, but merely arises from
the natural property possessed by thin bronze
of buckling under a bending stress, so as to
remain strained in the opposite direction after
the stress is removed. And this stress is applied
partly by the &#8216;distorting rod,&#8217; and partly by the
subsequent polishing, which, in an exactly
similar way, tends to make the thinner parts
more convex than the thicker.&#8221; The researches
of Ayrton and Perry may be said to have determined
once and for all the main cause of
the magic properties. No one has since disputed
the principal propositions of their memoir,
though it is certain that the differences of curvature
may be produced in several varieties of
operation.</p>

<p>Bertin, who wrote two years later, confirmed
the conclusions arrived at, and repeated on other
mirrors the experiments of Ayrton and Perry,
as well as those of Person and Govi. Finding
that the distortions produced by heating were
particularly efficacious in bringing out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
magic qualities, he sought to imitate them
mechanically, and, with the aid of the optician
Duboscq, constructed an apparatus for conferring
temporary convexity upon mirrors by
mounting them against an air-tight back, with
a cavity behind into which air could be driven
by a force-pump. With this apparatus he
examined the effects that are produced by drilling
cavities, cutting grooves, and etching depressions
in the backs of mirrors. Laurent,
taking up this line of suggestions, produced
magic mirrors of thin glass, etched into patterns
at the back, and silvered on the front face.
These, when mounted on an air-tight back,
could be made to show either positive or negative
figures by diminishing or increasing the
pressure of the air behind the mirror by means of
a simple india-rubber pear attached by a flexible
tube to an aperture in the back; the pressure
of the hand sufficing to bring out the optical
effects. Laurent further showed that by taking
an ordinary piece of mirror glass (patent plate
glass silvered at the back) magic effects could
be produced by lightly pressing against the
back hot pieces of metal on which a raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
pattern had been engraved. In this case the
portions of the mirror nearest in contact with
the hot metal became hotter than the other
parts, and expanding more, set up minute differences
of curvature sufficient to concentrate the
reflected rays of light from the heated parts.</p>

<p>About the same time Mendenhall, then in
Japan, made further observations, which were
communicated to the American Association
for the Advancement of Science at its meeting
at Cincinnati. Mendenhall was followed by
two Japanese observers,&mdash;both trained in physical
research in Europe,&mdash;Goto and Muraoka,
the latter of whom, while confirming the main
propositions that the effects are due to differences
of convexity, and that the convexity
is acquired during the process of <i>mege</i> or scoring
over with the <i>megebo</i>, gave some further details
learned from the mirror-makers of Tokio.
He showed that any plate, if thin enough,
whether of bronze, brass, copper, lead, zinc,
iron, or glass, acquires the property of convexity
on being scored over with scratches;
and he came to the conclusion that this surface-expansion
on the scored side of the metal arose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
from some sort of release of molecular tension
across the lines so scored. Like Ayrton, he
held that this production of convexity on the
scored surface explained the phenomenon that
a scratch made by a file or pointed tool on the
back causes a corresponding bright line to be
reflected from the face. In a second article
Muraoka sought to prove that the differences
of curvature are not really due to differences
of pressure during the operations of scoring
and surfacing, but are due to the unequal
rising-up of the metal in the thick and thin
parts when the surface is caused to expand by
scoring it over with scratches.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_pl_4.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate IV.</span></p>

<p>In May, 1886, Professors Ayrton and Perry,
having discovered that the act of amalgamating
with mercury the surface of a thick brass bar
produces a powerful expansion of the amalgamated
surface and bends the bar convexly,
made the further suggestion that the employment
by the Japanese mirror-polishers of a
mercury-amalgam might assist the operation
of the <i>megebo</i> in producing the differences of
curvature between the thinner and thicker
parts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>The author having from time to time picked
up a number of Japanese mirrors from dealers
in oriental curiosities, and having repeated all
the researches enumerated above and added
some others, is able to demonstrate very completely
the phenomena in question.</p>

<p>Plate I. depicts a mirror in the author&#8217;s
possession, about 7 inches in diameter, the
back of which bears in high relief a crest in
the form of a bird (<i>hoho</i>). The casting has
evidently been tooled up to give greater sharpness,
and the part in high relief has been ground
and polished. The pattern which this mirror
casts from its face is shown beside the mirror,
both being photographically reproduced. This
mirror shows the pattern with sunlight, or with
the light of the electric arc, or with lime-light.
It can also be shown to a few persons at a
time by means of the flame of a paraffin lamp
twenty feet away, or even by the light of an
ordinary candle a couple of feet away. In the
case of these weaker sources of light the mirror
must be held close to the white screen or card
upon which the image is to be received.</p>

<p>Plate II. is taken from a mirror upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
which there is, in high relief, polished, a crest
consisting of the imperial <i>kiri</i> within a circlet,
together with a landscape of storks and bamboos
in lower relief. In this case only the ornament
in high relief produces any effect: and
it is interesting to notice that, whereas the
circlet on the back is a simple flat band, the
circlet in the image (which is distorted in consequence
of a general distortion of the mirror
face as a whole) presents double lines. The
author is disposed to think that the ornament
on the back must in this instance have been
subjected to polishing subsequently to the front
face.</p>

<p>Plate III. represents a very thin mirror,
about 9&frac14; inches in diameter and not more than
0·04 inch thick in its thinnest parts. The
central character in high relief is surrounded
with the seven precious objects in lower relief.
Most of these may be seen more or less
distinctly in the luminous pattern cast from
the front.</p>

<p>Plate IV. is a rather smaller mirror, 6&#8542;
inches in diameter, having low-relief ornament
only; yet of this almost every detail is visible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
in the image as cast by electric light or sunlight.</p>

<p>Plate V. shows a mirror which has two
Chinese characters in high relief, polished,
with a background made up of symbols of
longevity&mdash;pine-tree, two storks, and a hairy-tailed
tortoise. But though these are in
almost as high relief as the polished letters,
only the former are to be distinguished in the
image. Here again the author conceives that
the two letters have been polished down subsequently
to the face; the pattern of these
parts having been thus, to a minute degree,
forced into the reflecting surface.</p>

<p>Plate VI. depicts a rectangular mirror, 15
inches high by 10&frac12; inches wide, and weighing
5&frac12; lbs. It is the only one of this form that he
has seen or heard of; though smaller square
mirrors of 3 to 4 inches in the side are not infrequent.
One of the latter, in his possession,
an old mirror covered at the back with Chinese
characters, has no magic qualities at all. The
large rectangular mirror is slightly convex, but
more so in its longer direction than in its
breadth. The bamboos in the pattern, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
not very highly raised, are in very sharp relief,
the mirror being, apparently, an <i>ichi mai buki</i>,
or artist&#8217;s proof. There are two raised lumps
on the back, apparently the remains of the parts
where the metal was poured into the mould;
and, curiously enough, neither these nor the
rims of the rocks in the foreground yield any
image, though they are more highly raised
than any part of the bamboos.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_pl_5.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate V.</span></p>

<p>To complete the proofs that the effects are
due to differences of curvature the author has
made the following observations.</p>

<p>By holding a magic mirror very obliquely to
the light one can discern traces of the pattern in
the face, especially if one is accustomed to examine
optical surfaces for small inequalities of
curvature. For example, on examining (at
oblique reflection) in such a mirror the image of
a horizontal window-bar or of the roof-line of a
house, one sees the straight line slightly curved
downwards out of the level wherever the
image is made from a slightly concave (or less
convex) part of the surface. Acting on this
hint the author found that if one chooses as an
object to be viewed in a mirror a pattern of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
narrow parallel straight lines, such as a finely-striped
blind, the pattern on the back of the
mirror can be dimly seen in the face, resembling
that species of line-engraving, sometimes
used for medallion portraits, in which the
whole picture is crossed by lines from side to
side, the lines being bent toward one another
or widened out to give effects of light and
shade. Another variety of the same experiment
is to place a ruled diffraction-grating of 100
lines to the inch (ruled in a silvered surface on
glass) close to a bright light, and with a short-focus
lens project the lines upon a screen.
Then interpose the magic mirror to throw
the luminous lines upon another screen, when
they will be seen with the usual magic image;
the bright lines concentrating into the bright
parts and avoiding the darker parts of the
luminous pattern.</p>

<p>By the use of the spherometer to measure the
surface curvatures of the mirror faces, it is easy
to show that the surface of the magic mirrors
is actually less convex, or even slightly concave,
over those parts where the substance of
the mirror is thick, as compared with those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
parts where the mirror is thin. For example,
the curvature of the rectangular mirror, Plate
VI., as measured from left to right over
the convex surface, is, on the average, about
0·2 dioptries (or its radius of curvature is
about 5 metres), but when measured at
points over the vertical bamboo stems, its curvature
falls to less than 0·05 dioptrie, and in
some parts is absolutely flat, or even slightly
concave.</p>

<p>Makers of mirrors and lenses for large telescopes
are accustomed to test the perfection of
their figure by a process known as Foucault&#8217;s,
in which the observer, after allowing light to
fall from a single well-defined point upon the
(concave) mirror at nearly normal incidence,
places his eye at the point where the reflected
rays converge to a focus, and then sees the
whole surface of the mirror uniformly bright,
save only such spots as differ in curvature from
the rest. In the case of convex mirrors it is
needful to interpose a large auxiliary convex
lens to reconcentrate the otherwise divergent
beam. Applying this method of investigation,
the author finds that it is quite easy in many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
cases to see in the front face the pattern that
the mirror bears on its back.</p>

<p>Lastly, the author has made one absolutely
direct proof of the inequalities of curvature of
the front surface. He took the mirror depicted
in Plate I., and having taken a mould of its
face in a composition of gutta-percha, he deposited
a firm layer of copper in the mould by
the electrotyping process. The type so made
was silvered and polished, when it was found
to reflect from its face the image of the bird
that was on the back of the original mirror;
the image was, however, less regular than that
from the mirror&#8217;s own face. Here, then, was
a magic mirror without any pattern on its back.</p>

<p>In repeating the experiments on heating, the
author found a very singular effect to be produced
by warming (with a flame) the back of
a thin piece of mirror glass while it reflected
from its face a grating of luminous lines thrown
upon it by a lamp as described above. As the
flame was passed rapidly across the back, the
whole pattern appeared to heave, as though a
wave had passed along it.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_pl_6.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate VI.</span></p>

<p>He was able also to reproduce writing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
luminous lines on a screen or wall by the
following device. A piece of thin sheet lead
(tea-chest lead) was laid on a bed of blotting-paper;
and upon this was written with a common
lead pencil any word desired, which therefore
was slightly indented into the lead. The sheet
was then pressed lightly against an ordinary
piece of mirror glass and heated from behind
by pressing against it a disk of hot metal.
The written letters touching the back of the
mirror warmed it, and made it curve at these
parts. Hence, placed in an appropriate divergent
beam of light, it threw the handwriting
upon the wall.</p>

<p>Following the hint given by Bertin&#8217;s research
upon the effect of bending mirrors by
air-pressure at the back, the author finds that
a similar effect is even more powerfully produced
by simple mechanical pressure. He
took a mirror which, though it had an excellent
reflecting face and a well-raised pattern
on the back, showed no magic properties, and
having clamped it in a wooden frame, he
applied screw pressure behind to force against
the back a slightly convex piece of soft wood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
covered with a pad of cloth. On turning the
screw the mirror at once became magic, and
was found, even after the screw had been
released, to retain some part of its magic property.
It was again distorted by screw pressure,
and while violently bent was heated to
anneal it somewhat. On removing the pressure
it was found to retain permanently all
the qualities of a good magic mirror, though
it is slightly more convex than mirrors ordinarily
are. Since then it has been found that
many mirrors which, when purchased, showed
no magic properties, can be converted into
magic mirrors, some by application of screw
pressure, some by mere bending by hand over
the knee, some by burnishing under pressure
the pattern at the back.</p>

<p>Engineers are so familiar with the circumstance
that when metal castings are rapidly
cooled the internal parts are in a state of
strain, that they are not astonished to find
that after a casting has been surfaced accurately
on one face the figure may alter slightly
by the mere release of internal strains in the
slow annealing of time. It is quite possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
that this too occurs with Japanese mirrors,
and that some of them may acquire with the
mere lapse of time magic qualities that they
do not show at first when newly polished.</p>

<p>There appears to be another species of magic
mirror, of which few examples are known,
having the property of showing in the face a
pattern entirely different from that on the back.
Three such are mentioned by Ayrton, though
it does not seem that he himself had inspected
any of them personally. One of these, which
he states to exist at Kamakura, the old capital
of the former Shoguns, is a religious mirror
about four inches and one-fifth high, by three
and a half wide, held in great reverence. In
the polished surface, when looked at very
obliquely, is seen the image of a Buddhist
priest. The pattern on the back is a rosary
in high relief with a branch of plum-blossom,
and a crescent moon rising out of the sea as a
background. It is said that this optical effect
is produced by chemically etching the surface
with an acid paste, and then repolishing. Professor
Ayrton, who had two mirrors made thus
by a Japanese mirror-maker, found that if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
face of a mirror that had so been etched was
repolished until every trace of the marks disappeared
in direct or oblique vision, they then
entirely disappeared also from the image cast
by the mirror in reflecting a beam of light
upon a screen. He greatly doubted whether
chemical means could produce a mirror possessed
of true magic properties. The cause of
the phenomena of the Kamakura mirror and
its congeners&mdash;should the facts be established
as narrated&mdash;therefore remains still to be explained.</p>

<p>Though in the case of the ordinary Japanese
mirrors science completely explains what would
otherwise seem to be a most mysterious and
unaccountable phenomenon, the explanation
itself involves a very remarkable fact, namely,
that there can exist such very delicate and
minute differences of curvature in the polished
face as to be practically invisible for ordinary
purposes, and difficult even of scientific detection,
and yet that those minute differences in
curvature should be in such exact correspondence
to the patterns on the back as to reproduce
those patterns in the reflected beams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
of light. The facts seem so utterly unlikely
<i>à priori</i> to be true, that one can only give full
credence to them after the most searching
scientific demonstration. But is not this, after
all, only another example of the truism that
when science explains away one mystery she
does so by establishing some truth that is itself
still more mysterious?</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Part II. Alleged References to Magic Mirrors.</span></h3>

<p>(<i>i.</i>) <span class="smcap">The Mirror of Pythagoras.</span> The
passage in question is in the <i>Physica Curiosa</i>
of Gaspard Schottus (4to Edition, Herbipolis,
1667), p. 538, referring to his own book on
magic, and runs as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Ibidem mentionem fecimus speculi Pythagorae,
in quo sanguine dicitur scripsisse quae
volebat significare, et eo ad Lunam obverso
commonstrasse res exaratas stanti a tergo in
disco Lunae.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The reference is to another passage on page
553 of Schottus&#8217; <i>Magia Divinatoria</i> (Herbip.,
1657-59, par. iv.), in the chapter De
Catoptromantia:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Huc referunt aliqui speculum Pythagorae
cujus meminit Agrippa in <i>Retractat. de Magia</i>,
cap. <i>de Prestigiis</i>, qui sanguine perscripsisse
dicitur, quae collibuisset, in speculo et eo ad
Lunam obverso, commonstrasse res exaratas
stanti a tergo in disco Lunae. Hoc si verum
est, utique non naturaliter contingit sed ope
Daemonis.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>In the same work, par. i., p. 438-440, is a
discussion of the proposition: &#8220;Utrum in
lunari disco aliquid legendum exhiberi potest
arte catoptrographica.&#8221; He says that Baptista
Porta maintained this in his Natural Magic
(cap. xvii., lib. 17). He also quotes from the
<i>Philosophia Occulta</i> of Cornelius Agrippa (lib.
i., cap. 6) as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Si litteras parabolico speculo inscripseris
idque tempori plenilunii Lunae exposueris eae
litterae ceu in vasto quodam speculo impressae
reflexaeque ubilibet locorum legi poterunt.
Ita Pythagoram aiunt, dum Hydrunti moraretur,
litteras Lunae inscriptas Constantinopoli
amicis legendas dedisse.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is also a passage in Dr. Thomas
Browne&#8217;s <i>Pseudodoxia Epidemica</i> (Vulgar Errours),
p. 60 (Edition of 1650), in reference
to this myth: &#8220;Which is a way of intelligence
very strange; and would requite the Art of
Pythagoras; who could read a reverse in the
Moon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Other references in occult literature to the
alleged mirror of Pythagoras are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Athanasius Kircher.</span> <i>Ars Magna Lucis
et Umbrae</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> (Cryptologia, cap. i.) (Romae,
1646, fol.), p. 908. (Quotes from Cornelius
Agrippa and Porta, and denounces the account
as absurd, and against natural possibility.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bubalus.</span> <i>Commentationem de Angelis</i>
(Lugduni, 1622, fol.), 9-50, art. 1, quaesito
2, difficult. 2, § 3, pp. 64-66. (Combats
views of Paracelsus.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paracelsus.</span> <i>Magia</i>, lib. 5, de Speculi
constitutione. (Distinguishes five kinds of
alleged magic mirrors; none of them, however,
having any optical significance.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boissardus.</span> <i>Tractatus de Divinatione</i> (Oppenheim,
1616, folio), p. 297.</p></blockquote>

<p>(<i>ii.</i>) <span class="smcap">Aulus Gellius.</span> Carus Sterne (<i>Gartenlaube</i>,
1877) and Ayrton (<i>Journal Royal
Institution</i>, 1879) refer to Aulus Gellius as
having written of mirrors which &#8220;sometimes
reflected their backs and sometimes did not.&#8221;
The reference appears to be a mistaken one;
for all I have been able to find in Aulus Gellius
is the following passage in the <i>Noctes Atticæ</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
bk. xvi., ch. xviii. (which is upon that branch
of Geometry called <span title="optikê">&#8000;&#960;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8052;</span>):</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span title="Optikê">&#8008;&#960;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8052;</span> facit multa demiranda id genus; (1) ut in
speculo uno imagines unius rei plures appareant; (2)
<i>item, ut speculum, in loco certo positum, nihil imaginet,
aliorsum translatum, faciat imagines</i>; (3) item, si rectus
speculum spectes, imago fiat tua hujusmodi, ut caput
deorsum videatur pedes sursum.</p></blockquote>

<p>The passage which I have put into italics
appears to have been mistaken in meaning.
In Beloe&#8217;s translation, vol. iii., p. 249, this
clause is rendered as follows: &#8220;A glass placed
in a certain position shows nothing. Turn it,
and it shows many things.&#8221; This is hardly
adequate. More accurately it should run:
&#8220;A mirror set in a certain place shows no
image, but when transferred to another position
produces images.&#8221; There is nothing in this at
all suggestive of the mirror reflecting from its
face the pattern on its back.</p>

<p>(<i>iii.</i>) <span class="smcap">Muratori.</span> Sterne (<i>op. cit.</i>) and
Ayrton (<i>op. cit.</i>) refer vaguely to the Italian
historian Muratori as the authority for accounts
of a &#8220;magic mirror found under the pillow of
the Bishop of Verona, who was afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
condemned to death by Martin (<i>sic</i>) della
Scala, as well as of the one discovered in the
house of Colla da Rienzi (<i>sic</i>) on the back of
which was the word &#8216;Fiorone.&#8217;&#8221; The bishop
in question was Bartolomeo dalla Scala, who
was put to death in 1338 by Mastino della
Scala, as narrated by Muratori (<i>Annali d&#8217;Italia</i>,
vol. viii., p. 212, of the folio edition of 1744-49).
Cola di Rienzo (or Rienzi) is mentioned many
times in the same volume viii. I have not,
however, been able to find in this work the
mention of the mirror in either case. Neither
have I found any as yet in Lessmann&#8217;s life
of Mastino della Scala (Berlin, 1829); nor
in Du Cerceau&#8217;s <i>Life and Times of Rienzi</i>
(Lond. 1836). Muratori was, however, a
prolific writer. Amongst his works were:
<i>Delle forze dell&#8217; Intendimento Umano</i>; <i>Riflessioni
sopra il Buon Gusto nelle Scienze e nelle
Arte</i>; <i>La Filosofia Morale</i>. It is possible
that the reference may be to some passage in
these. Muratori also refers to a <i>Vita di Cola
di Rienzo</i>, the authorship of which is unknown
to me.</p>

<p>(<i>iv.</i>) <span class="smcap">Von Humboldt.</span> In 1830 Von Humboldt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
brought a supposed magic mirror from
Berlin to Paris to exhibit it to members of
the <i>Académie des Sciences</i>. It was indeed
shown to some of them at the apartments of
M. Arago at the Observatoire. No reference
to the occurrence is to be found in the journals
of the Académie, published or private, or in
any contemporary journal. Perhaps the reason
is that, as is known, the experiments proved a
total failure. My information on the subject
is derived from Bertin (<i>Ann. Chim. Phys.</i>, xxii.,
1881, p. 478).</p>

<p>(<i>v.</i>) <span class="smcap">Babinet.</span> The name of Babinet is
sometimes given along with that of Arago in
connection with this subject; but I am unable
to find that he did anything.</p>

<p>(<i>vi.</i>) <span class="smcap">Harting (Pieter).</span> In their 1878
paper Ayrton and Perry refer to a short paper
by Professor Harting in the <i>Album der Natuur</i>
some years before. It appears that this was
a short-lived periodical, edited by Harting and
Logeman, which was issued at Haarlem (A. C.
Kruseman, publisher) in 1872. There is a
single part (No. 3 of vol. i.) in the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Museum. No copy containing the article in
question is known in England.</p>

<p>(<i>vii.</i>) <span class="smcap">Tennant, Prof. James.</span> The
well-known mineralogist Tennant is believed
to have issued, about the year 1869, a small
pamphlet of about four pages on the subject of
Japanese mirrors. No copy has yet been found.</p>

<p>(<i>Abstracted from the account given by Mr. E.

<p class="drop-cap">OF all the gods of old Japan, there
were two whom the father of the
gods, Izanagi no mikoto, loved
most. These were Amaterasu
oho-mi-kami, who shone beautifully
and illuminated the heavens and the earth,
and her brother, Susanowo no mikoto, who
was ruler of the blue sea. Amaterasu was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
made ruler of heaven, which she reached by
climbing up the pillar on which the sky rested.
Susanowo no mikoto, who was ever a <i>mauvais
sujet</i>, neglected his kingdom, so much so that
the rivers and seas all dried up. Amongst other
evil deeds, he offended his sister Amaterasu by
throwing into the room where she was weaving
the body of a piebald horse which he had flayed,
so terrifying her that she hurt herself with her
shuttle, and retired in wrath to a cave, which
she closed with a rock door. Heaven and
earth were long plunged into utter darkness,
during which time the more turbulent of the
gods made a noise like the buzzing of flies,
and the general disaster was great.</p>

<p>Then the gods held a council in the bed of one
of the dry rivers as to how they might appease
the anger of the great goddess, and at the suggestion
of Taka-mi-musu-bi no kami the plan of
campaign was entrusted to the wisest of the
gods, Ame-no-koya-ne no mikoto, who suggested
that Amaterasu should be enticed out
by artifice to look at her own image. Accordingly
two gods, Amatsu-mara no mikoto, the
Japanese Vulcan, and Ishi-kori-dome no mikoto,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
were set to work to make a mirror of the
shape of the sun, and of metal taken from the
mines in heaven. Their bellows were made
from the whole skin of a deer. The first two
mirrors were voted too small, but the third
was large and beautiful. Five gods were then
ordered to prepare striped cloth and fine cloth
from bark and hemp fibre, and two other gods
erected posts and built a palace near the cave.
Then Taka-mi-musu-bi no kami commanded
another god, Ame-no-kushi-akaru-tama no mikoto,
to make a string of <i>magatama</i>, or curiously
curved charms, such as were worn in those
days as ornaments, whilst two other gods made
wands from the sakaki tree. Having by strange
divinations satisfied themselves that their preparations
were likely to come to a successful
issue, the gods began their campaign.</p>

<p>First, Ame-no-koya-ne no mikoto pulled up
a sakaki tree by the roots and hung upon it the
string of charms, the mirror, and the strips of
cloth. This trophy was held up by Ame-no-futo-damo
no mikoto in front of the cave whilst
Ame-no-koya-ne no mikoto pronounced an
oration in honour of the goddess. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
placed in concealment near the cavern door
the god Ta-jikara-wo no mikoto, the Japanese
Hercules. Then they set a number of cocks
to crow in concert, and organized a dance to
the accompaniment of music. A lively goddess,
Ame-no Uzume no mikoto (or O-kame),
she of the diminutive forehead and swollen
cheeks, officiated as mistress of the ceremonies.
She blew a bamboo flute, whilst the assembled
deities kept time to the music by striking together
two pieces of wood. Two other gods
performed upon a primitive harp with six strings,
which they bowed, violin-like, with grass.
Uzume no mikoto adjusted her head-dress and
bound up her sleeves preparatory to a dance,
and flourished around a spear decorated with
grass and bells. Bonfires were lighted, and a
large circular box was laid upon the earth, upon
which Uzume mounted to execute a <i>pas seul</i>
As she flung herself about to the strains there
descended upon her the spirit of folly, which
possessed her and inspired her to sing. She
sang a quatrain of six syllables to each line,
which, though in modern Japanese it reads
merely &#8220;One, two, three, four, five,&#8221; and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
on, may also be rendered in old Japanese with
the following meaning:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Gods, look now at the lid;</div>
<div class="verse">The Goddess no longer is hid.</div>
<div class="verse">Our longings she now satisfies:</div>
<div class="verse">Behold my bosom and thighs.</div>
</div></div>

<p>And as she pronounced these words she shook
off her garments one by one, whilst finally the
air shook with a burst of Homeric laughter
from the assembled gods.</p>

<p>Hereupon Amaterasu oho-mi-kami, slightly
opening the cavern door, called out from within,
&#8220;I fancied that in consequence of my retirement
both heaven and Japan were in darkness.
Why has Ame-no Uzume danced, and why
do the gods laugh?&#8221; Thereupon Uzume
answered, &#8220;I dance and they laugh because
there is here an honourable deity who surpasses
your glory&#8221; (alluding to the mirror).
As she said these words Ame-no-futo-dama no
mikoto, who held the trophy, pushed the
mirror toward her, so astonishing her that she
came forward to look. As they were putting
the mirror into the mouth of the cave it struck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
against the door and received a flaw, which it
bears to this day. As the goddess came forward
Ame-no tajikara-wo-no kami pulled open
the door and dragged her forth, whilst Ame-no-koya-ne
no mikoto passed behind with a straw
rope to prevent her return.</p>

<p>So light was restored to the world; and in
after days Amaterasu oho-mi-kami gave the
mirror to her adopted grandson Nini-gi no
mikoto, who in turn handed it down to his
descendants, who, after various turns of fortune,
placed it, in the year 4 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, in the sacred
shrine on the bank of the Isuzu river, by the
village of Uji in Isé, where it is preserved to
this day with religious care.</p>

ORIENTAL WRITINGS UPON THE<br />
MAGIC MIRROR.</h2></div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_069b.jpg"  alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">M. STANISLAS JULIEN, the
erudite author of <i>Les Industries
anciennes et modernes de l&#8217;empire
chinois</i>, has given the following
extract from the fifty-sixth volume
of the Chinese encyclopædia called <i>Ke-chi-king-yonen</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Théou-kouang-kien</i>, or <i>Mirrors which let
the light pass through</i> (an expression due to a
vulgar error). If one receives the rays of the
sun upon the polished surface of one of these
mirrors, the characters or flowers which are in
relief on the back are reproduced faithfully in
the (reflected) image of the disk. Chin-kouo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
(a writer who flourished in the middle of the
eleventh century) speaks with admiration of
them in his memoirs entitled <i>Mong-ki-pi-tân</i>,
book xix., fol. 5. The poet Kin-ma celebrated
them in verse; but, down to the time of the
Mongolian emperors, no author had been able
to explain this phenomenon. Ou-tseu-hing,
who lived under this dynasty (between 1260
and 1341), has the merit of having first done
so. This is how he expresses himself on this
subject:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;When one places one of these mirrors
facing the sun, and causes it to reflect, upon a
very near wall, the image of its disk, one sees
distinctly appear therein the ornaments or
characters which exist in relief upon the back.
Now the cause of this phenomenon, which arises
from the distinct employment of fine copper and
of crude copper. If on the back of the mirror
one has produced, by casting it in a mould, a
dragon arranged within a circle, one engraves
deeply on the face of the disk an exactly
similar dragon. Next, one fills the deeply-chiselled
cuts with a somewhat baser copper;
then one incorporates this metal with the first,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
which ought to be of a finer quality, by submitting
the mirror to the action of fire; after
which one flattens and smoothens down the
face of the mirror, and spreads over it a slight
layer of lead (tin?).</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;When one turns toward the sun the polished
disk of a mirror so prepared, and reflects its
image upon a wall, it distinctly presents bright
tints and dark tints, which come, these from
the purest parts of the copper, those from the
baser parts.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ou-tseu-hing, to whom we owe the preceding
explanation, tells us that he has seen a
mirror of this sort broken into fragments, and
that he recognized for himself the accuracy
of his description.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ayrton quotes from a Japanese work, the
<i>Shim-pen-kamakura-shi</i>, or New Collection of
Writings about Kamakura, a description of a
temple-mirror, which when looked at obliquely
shows the face of a Buddhist priest, not resembling
in the least the raised ornament on
the back (see p. 45, <i>supra</i>).</p>

<p>The same authority refers to the <i>Kokon-i-to</i>,
or Genealogy of the Old and New Physicians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
for an alleged process of producing magic
effects on mirrors by treating the surface with
a peculiar paste. The recipe is as follows:
&#8220;Take ten parts of <i>shio</i> (gamboge), one of
<i>funso</i>, and one of <i>hosha</i> (borax). Powder them
thoroughly, and mix them to the consistency
of a paste with a little dilute glue. If any
pattern be drawn on the surface of a mirror
with this paste, and then allowed to dry, the
pattern will be seen, even after polishing, if
looked at obliquely.&#8221;</p>

<p>It appears that this process fails in reality to
give any result. The process of inlaying described
by Ou-tseu-hing is also an error.
The magic effect is certainly not produced in
this way. Probably he was misled by the
circumstance that flaws in the bronze castings
are sometimes filled by the insertion of soft
copper beads.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
